It allows you to quickly search through your bookmarks, open tabs or history.\r\n\r\nTo get quicker access to the plugin add a shortcut from the extensions settings page!\r\n\r\nTo navigate between the three search sections you can use the Ctrl+ left/righ arrow keys. Additionally using just the up/down keys (without Ctrl) will select the previous or next item in the list.\r\n\r\nThere are four modes of search*. \r\nDefault: Searches for exact match on title and exact match on url\r\n@: Adding the '@' symbol before the query, it will return only items with exact match on the title, ignoring the url.\r\n#: Adding the '#' symbol before the query, it will return only items with exact match on the url, ignoring the title.\r\n>: Adding the '>' symbol before the query, it will return only bookmark items that are in a folder path that contains the query string, ignoring url and title.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The first three mode are applicable to the 'tabs' and 'bookmarks' search while the last one is applicable only on 'bookmarks' search. The history search uses the build in chrome function for searching history.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
