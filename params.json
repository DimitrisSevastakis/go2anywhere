{"name":"Go2Anywhere","tagline":"This extension for chrome allows you to search through your bookmarks, open tabs and history in a similar way to Sublime Text","body":"Go2Anywhere\r\n===============\r\n<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0ByZ2MyLIVr0fR28tRkpSLWoyNk0'>\r\nWelcome to the go2anywhere wiki!\r\n\r\nThis extension for chrome allows you to search through your bookmarks in a similar way to Sublime Text\r\n\r\nBy default, it searches through your bookmarks, tabs or history looking for a match on the title of the bookmark and exact match on the url of the bookmark.\r\n\r\nSwitch quickly between the tabs/bookmarks/history sections using ctrl+arrow keys.\r\n\r\nTo get quicker access to the extension assign a keyboard shortcut to it from the extensions settings page (\"ctrl + p\" for sublime fans) .\r\n\r\nSearching with the '@' symbol before your query it searches only for exact match on the title. Searching with the '#' symbol before your query it searches only for exact match on the url. Searching with the '>' symbol before your query it will search only for bookmarks that are under a folder that match the query (very useful).\r\n\r\n'Enter' opens the selected bookbark in a new tab and switching focus to that new tab. 'Shift + Enter' opens the selected bookmark in a new tab while maintaining the focus on the current tab. 'ctrl + a' Opens all search results in new tabs on the current window. 'Ctrl + Shift + a' Opens all search results in new tabs on a new window.\r\n\r\nYou can combine the last type of search in the following way: Lets say you have a bookmark folder named \"shopping\" where you save all your shopping related stuff, and within that folder you have another folder named \"cart\"\r\n\r\n'>shopping/cart | headphones' \r\n'>shopping cart | headphones'\r\n\r\nThe two examples above are (almost) equivalent.They both return the bookmarks that are under the folder shopping/cart and has the word headphones in the title or url. In the case of the second example, the folder does not have to be a direct child of shopping, rather both of the words have to exist in the bookmark path.\r\n\r\nSimilarly :\r\n\r\n'>shopping/cart | @headphones' \r\n'>shopping/cart | #ebay.com'\r\n\r\nYou can use the symbols mentioned above to do a search within a bookmark folder using just the title or just the url.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
