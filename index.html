Welcome to the go2anywhere wiki!</p>

<p>This extension for chrome allows you to search through your bookmarks in a similar way to Sublime Text</p>

<p>By default, it searches through your bookmarks, tabs or history looking for a match on the title of the bookmark and exact match on the url of the bookmark.</p>

<p>Switch quickly between the tabs/bookmarks/history sections using ctrl+arrow keys.</p>

<p>To get quicker access to the extension assign a keyboard shortcut to it from the extensions settings page ("ctrl + p" for sublime fans) .</p>

<p>Searching with the '@' symbol before your query it searches only for exact match on the title. Searching with the '#' symbol before your query it searches only for exact match on the url. Searching with the '&gt;' symbol before your query it will search only for bookmarks that are under a folder that match the query (very useful).</p>

<p>'Enter' opens the selected bookbark in a new tab and switching focus to that new tab. 'Shift + Enter' opens the selected bookmark in a new tab while maintaining the focus on the current tab. 'ctrl + a' Opens all search results in new tabs on the current window. 'Ctrl + Shift + a' Opens all search results in new tabs on a new window.</p>

<p>You can combine the last type of search in the following way: Lets say you have a bookmark folder named "shopping" where you save all your shopping related stuff, and within that folder you have another folder named "cart"</p>

<p>'&gt;shopping/cart | headphones' 
'&gt;shopping cart | headphones'</p>

<p>The two examples above are (almost) equivalent.They both return the bookmarks that are under the folder shopping/cart and has the word headphones in the title or url. In the case of the second example, the folder does not have to be a direct child of shopping, rather both of the words have to exist in the bookmark path.</p>

<p>Similarly :</p>

<p>'&gt;shopping/cart | <a href="https://github.com/headphones" class="user-mention">@headphones</a>' 
'&gt;shopping/cart | #ebay.com'</p>

<p>You can use the symbols mentioned above to do a search within a bookmark folder using just the title or just the url.</p>
