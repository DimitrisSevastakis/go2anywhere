Go2Anywhere
===============

This extension for chrome allows you to search through your bookmarks in a similar way to Sublime Text

By default, it searches through your bookmarks, tabs or history looking for a match on the title of the bookmark and exact match on the url of the bookmark.

Switch quickly between the tabs/bookmarks/history sections using ctrl+arrow keys.

To get quicker access to the extension assign a keyboard shortcut to it from the extensions settings page.

Searching with the '@' symbol before your query it searches only for exact match on the title. 
Searching with the '#' symbol before your query it searches only for exact match on the url.
