fuzzy_bookmarks
===============

This extension for chrome allows you to search through your bookmarks in a similar way to Sublime Text

By default, it searches through your bookmarks looking for a "fuzzy" match on 
the title of the bookmark and exact match on the url of the bookmark. 

Searching with the '@' symbol before your query it searches only for exact match on the title.
Searching with the '#' symbol before your query it searches only for exact match on the url.


TODO:
Hitting enter still doesn't do anything, but in the future it will open the selected bookmark.
The selection can now go out of sight, this will also be fixed.
